Enterprise Three-Tier Network Architecture Project

This repository contains the full configuration, design files, and documentation for my enterprise-grade three-tier network project, completed as part of my networking coursework. The project focuses on building a scalable, secure, and highly available network using real-world enterprise technologies and best practices.

🚀 Project Overview

The network was designed and implemented using a structured core–distribution–access architecture and includes:

🔹 Layer 3 Routing

RIP configuration and optimisation

OSPF multiarea deployment

EIGRP comparison & evaluation

Static and default route design

Introductory BGP exploration for external connectivity

Routing redundancy and convergence testing

🔹 Layer 2 Switching

VLAN creation and segmentation

Trunking & access port configuration

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for loop prevention

EtherChannel for link aggregation

VTP for VLAN management

DHCP services

BPDU Guard / PortFast for edge security

🔹 Wireless & Mobility

Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) configuration

Secure corporate SSID + isolated guest wireless network

Authentication server integration (RADIUS/TACACS+)

Wireless security hardening

🔹 Security & VPN

Site-to-site VPN implementation

Gateway redundancy

Access control and device authentication

🔹 Monitoring & Logging

Syslog server integration

SNMP configuration for network monitoring and alerts

Logging hierarchy and troubleshooting workflows
